GTK+, or the GIMP ToolKit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application suites.

GTK+ is written in C but has been designed from the ground up to support a wide range of languages, not only C/C++. Using GTK+ from languages such as Python and JavaScript (especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder) provides an effective method of application development.

GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all developers, including those developing proprietary software, without any license fees or royalties.

GTK+ has been created in 1996 for the GIMP --- the GNU Image Manipulation Program --- but has quickly become a general-purpose library used by a large number of applications including the GNU project's GNOME desktop.

\section{Architecture Overview}

Over time GTK+ has been built up to be based on other libraries, also developed by the GTK+ team:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{GLib}, a low-level core library that forms the basis of GTK+. It provides data structure handling for C, portability wrappers and interfaces for such run-time functionality as an event loop, threads, dynamic loading, an object system (GObject) and high-level input/output APIs (GIO).

  \item \textbf{Pango}, a library for layout and rendering of text with an emphasis on internationalization. It forms the core of text and font handling for GTK+.

  \item \textbf{Cairo}, a library for 2D graphics with support for multiple output devices (including the X Window System, Win32) while producing a consistent output on all media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available.

  \item \textbf{ATK}, a library for a set of interfaces providing accessibility. By supporting the ATK interfaces, an application or toolkit can be used with tools such as screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices.

  \item \textbf{GDK}, or the GIMP Drawing Kit, is the abstraction layer that allows GTK+ to support multiple windowing systems. GDK provides backends for X11, Windows, Mac OS X, Wayland, Mir, and a web browser.
\end{itemize}
